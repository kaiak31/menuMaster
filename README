Welcome to menuMaster:

This program will accept a price file, a list of food items that someone wants to eat, and outputs the restaurant they should go to, along the total price it will cost them. 

The price list is a CSV file in the format:
restaurant ID, price, item label


Execution: 
Goto program directory
Type:
	php menuMaster.php <price_file>.csv item1 item2 .....etc.



Enjoy!!
